		DicomEditor is a stand-alone DICOM viewer
		and general anonymizer that supports supports DICOM images.
		The DICOM anonymizer script can be edited directly in the program.

		<p>On a Windows machine, you can run the program by double-clicking it or by
		launching a command window, navigating to the DicomEditor directory,
		and typing: 
		<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>java -jar DicomEditor.jar</code>
		
		<p>If the anonymizer reports errors that are not obvious from the
		text shown in the Results pane, you may get additional information
		by running the program in a command window.

		<p>If an out-of-memory error occurs, you may assign more memory to
		the program by running it in a command window with the command:
		<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>java -Xmx768m -jar DicomEditor.jar</code>

		<p><b>The Directory Tab</b>
		
		<p>The Directory tab has a left and right pane. The left pane provides
		navigation through the files on the computer. The right pane displays
		the results of actions. At the bottom of the right pane, there are buttons
		to initiate the functions provided by the program.
		
		<p>The pulldown menu in the upper right of the Directory pane allows
		selection of the file system root that will be displayed in the
		directory tree.
		
		<p>The directory tree does not track changes in the directory structure
		that occur behind the program's back. You can refresh the directory tree
		by clicking the root of the tree.

		<p>The button in the lower right of the Directory pane displays a dialog
		that allows selection of the file extensions that are displayed
		in the directory tree. If the list of extensions includes an asterisk,
		all files are displayed. There is a special notation, "[dcm]", that
		selects files whose names contain only numerals and periods. This can
		be used, for example, to select images on DICOM CDs.
		
		<p>The <b>Anonymize</b> button starts the anonymization
		process. Which files are processed depends on whether a file or a directory is selected
		in the Directory pane and on whether the <b>Include subdirectories</b> checkbox
		is selected:
		<ul>
		<li>If a single file is selected, that file is processed.</li>
		<li>If a directory is selected and the <b>Include subdirectories</b> checkbox is
		not selected, all the files in the selected directory are processed, but no
		files in subdirectories are processed.</li>
		<li>If a directory is selected and the <b>Include subdirectories</b> checkbox is
		selected, all the files in the selected directory and all its subdirectories
		are processed.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The <b>Change names of modified files</b> checkbox determines whether the anonymization
		process modifies the file or instead creates a new file with "-no-phi" appended to the name.
		<ul>
		<li>If <b>Change names of modified files</b> is selected, the anonymizer will not anonymize
		files whose names end in "-no-phi". To anonymize those files, you must deselect the checkbox.
		<li>If <b>Change names of modified files</b> is selected AND <b>Use SOPIUID for name</b> is selected,
		the anonymizer will not use the "-no-phi" suffix, but will instead rename the anonymized
		file to the SOP Instance UID of the anonymized object.
		<li>If <b>Use SOPIUID for name</b> is checked, anonymized DICOM files will be named to
		their SOPInstanceUID values followed by ".dcm".
		</ul>
		
		<p><b>Important Note:</b> The program anonymizes in the event thread, so
		there is no way to stop it while it is running except to kill the program. Thus, you
		should be careful when selecting the Include Subdirectories checkbox.
		
		<p>Events that occur during the anonymization process are logged in the Results pane.
		
		<p> The <b>Fix VRs</b> button works on the same set of files as the <b>Anonymize</b> button, but instead of
		anonymization, it only corrects certain elements in the DICOM object which have incorrect VRs. 
		This function always overwrites the original file, and renaming is not performed.

		<p> The <b>Clear Preamble</b> button works on the same set of files as the <b>Anonymize</b> button, but instead of
		anonymization, it only overwrites the preambles of DICOM files with zeros. 
		This function always overwrites the original file, and renaming is not performed.

		<p><b>The Viewer Tab</b>

		<p>The Viewer tab displays the currently selected DICOM image. If the image contains multiple frames,
		the Next Frame and Previous Frame buttons sequence through 
		the frames. Frame sequencing is also provided through the mouse wheel. 
		
		<p>
		Zoom, pan, and window width and level 
		functions are provided through icons in the upper right of the window. 
		
		<p>The window width and level can also
		be set manually by typing values into the provided text boxes. When entering text in the window width and level 
		boxes, the values do not take effect until the Enter key is pressed.
		
		<p>The Save As JPEG button saves the image, reduced to the width specified in a popup dialog.
		
		<p><b>The Editor Tab</b>
		
		<p>The Editor tab displays the element contents of the selected DICOM image.
		
		<!--
		Certain elements in the
		metadata (most of the ones that are textual) are editable.
		<p>To edit an element, click on its (group,element) designation. A dialog box will appear
		allowing you to change the value of the element.
		<p>If you have changed an element, the Save and Save All buttons will be enabled. Save only saves the
		changes made to the current image. Save All applies the changes to all the
		images with the same StudyInstanceUID in the current directory.
		<p>An element designation displayed in red is one that could cause the anonymizer to call its quarantine
		function and leave the image untouched. If you anonymize an image and the Results pane shows that
		the anonymizer called the
		quarantine function, look at the values in the red elements and see if there is something wrong.
		<p>To save a JPEG version of the currently displayed image, click the Save As JPEG button. A dialog
		box will appear allowing you to specify the maximum width of the saved image. The actual width of the
		saved image will be the minimum of the width of the DICOM image and the maximum width you specify.
		The height will be scaled to maintain the aspect ratio.

		<p><b>The Anonymizer Tab</b>
		
		<p>The DICOM Anonymizer is driven by a script file called "dicom-anonymizer.script" located in the same directory
		where the DicomEditor program is stored. A default version is included in the installation.
		<p>
		The Anonymizer Tab displays the DICOM anonymizer scripts. You can edit the scripts and click the Save button.
		Changes are not effective until the scripts are saved. If you make a change and decide you made an error
		before saving, click the Reset button and the scripts will be refreshed from the last saved version.
		
		<p>The DICOM anonymizer script functions are documented in http://mircwiki.rsna.org/index.php?title=The_CTP_DICOM_Anonymizer.

		<!--
		<p>The XML anonymizer is driven by a script file called "xml-anonymizer.script" located in
		the same directory where the DicomEditor program is stored. This file is not delivered
		as part of the installation, so you must construct it yourself using any text editor
		(e.g., TextPad). Because XML is very general, the script language is different from
		that of the DICOM anonymizer. It is also different in order to make it look XPath-like
		for the benefit of XSL wizards.

		<p>The XML anonymizer script functions are documented in http://mircwiki.rsna.org/index.php?title=The_CTP_XML_Anonymizer.

		<h2>The Encryption Key</h2>
		The re-identification system which is part of the anonymizer encrypts
		the keys in its database to make it more difficult for a hacker to acquire
		protected health information. The encryption key is a string of text that
		can be thought of as a password. You have the option to define your own key
		or to use a default key that is stored in the program. A good key is about
		20 characters long, not counting any spaces.
		<p>
		When the program starts, if it finds an existing re-identification database
		it checks to see whether the key to the database is the default. If it is not,
		it prompts the user for the key.
		<p>
		If your system is on a secure network, then using the default key may be
		more convenient, since the prompt is suppressed. If your system is in a
		less secure place, you should define your own key the first time the program
		is run. Once the key for a database is defined, it cannot be changed. To
		start a new re-identification database, you must remove the idtable.properties
		file from the DicomEditor directory and restart the program, causing it to
		create a new database and request a key the next time it runs.
